###### Homework Assignment #19: Build Tools

**Details:**
 
Although we spent a long time focusing on Webpack, it's not the only bundler out there. Here's a comparison between Webpack and some of the other popular solutions:

For this homework assignment, choose one of the other bundlers from that list, and dive into their documentation. Spend some time learning how to use it, and then prepare a brief presentation explaining how the bundler works, what you like about it, and what use-case it's a good fit for.

Your presentation can take any form: a powerpoint, prezi, keynote, pdf, etc. It's up to you!

**Extra Credit:**

Similar to the above, we spent a long time talking about Gulp, but Grunt is also a good choice. For extra credit, learn how to use Grunt and prepare a separate presentation on that topic. Your presentation should focus on comparing and contrasting Gulp and Grunt, and explaining which use-cases both are good for.


**Video Component:**

Make a screencast walking us through your presentation and any code samples you wrote for it. If you're comfortable doing so, please narrate as you go and explain what you're showing us.


**Turning it In:**

One of the first slides in this course is called "How to Turn in Homework" review that slide for details on how to send your assignment to us (and receive a grade).
